# Real\-time analysis using the built\-in models<a name="realtime-console-analysis"></a>

You can use the Amazon Comprehend console to analyze the contents of a document up to 5,000 characters long\. The document can be English or one of the other languages supported by Amazon Comprehend\. The results are shown in the console so that you can review the analysis\.

To start analyzing documents, sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amazon Comprehend console\.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/home?region=us-east-1#api-explorer:)

You can replace the sample text with your own text and then choose **Analyze** to get an analysis of your text\. Below the text being analyzed, the **Results** pane shows more information about the text\.
