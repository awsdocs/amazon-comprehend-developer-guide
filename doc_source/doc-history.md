| [New feature added](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-document-classification-training.html#multiclass-multilabel) | Amazon Comprehend now provides support for a second mode in asynchronous Custom Classification for documents that provides greater flexibility when applying custom classes to documents\.

For example, a movie can be classified as both science fiction and action at the same time\. For more information, see [Multi\-Class and Multi\-Label Modes in Custom Classification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-document-classification-training.html#multiclass-multilabel)\.  | December 19, 2019 |

| [New feature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/class-tagging.html) | Amazon Comprehend provides tags for Custom Classifiers and Custom Entity Recognizers, which can be used as metadata that enables you to organize, filter, and control access to your resources with a finer level of control than ever\.

The result is end\-to\-end security\. For more information, see [KMS Encryption in Amazon Comprehend](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/kms-in-comprehend.html)  | March 28, 2019 |
