# Creating and Using Custom Classifiers<a name="getting-started-document-classification"></a>

You can create and train custom classifiers using the console, and then run asynchronous classification jobs to analyze your documents\. You can also use the same custom model and add an endpoint to it to run custom classification requests to gain real\-time \(synchronous\) insights about your text\. This section shows you how to create a classifier using the console and then both how to use it to run an asynchronous classification job, or how to create an endpoint for it and run a real\-time classification request\.
