# Amazon Comprehend API permissions: Actions, resources, and conditions reference<a name="comprehend-api-permissions-ref"></a>

Use the tables in the [ Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Comprehend](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazoncomprehend.html) section of the *Service Authorization Reference* as a reference when setting up [Access control](auth-and-access-control.md#access-control)\. The tables include each Amazon Comprehend API operation, the corresponding action for which you can grant permissions to perform the action, and the AWS resource for which you can grant the permissions\. You specify the actions in the policy's `Action` field, and you specify the resource value in the policy's `Resource` field\. 

To specify conditions in your policy statements, you can use the condition keys that are specific to Amazon Comprehend\. You can also use AWS\-wide condition keys in your Amazon Comprehend policies\. For a complete list of AWS\-wide keys, see [Available keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html#AvailableKeys) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

**Note**  
To specify an action, use the `comprehend:` prefix followed by the API operation name, for example, `comprehend:DetectEntities`\.
