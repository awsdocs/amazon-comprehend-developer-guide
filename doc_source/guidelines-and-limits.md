# Guidelines and quotas<a name="guidelines-and-limits"></a>

Many of the Amazon Comprehend quotas shown here can be increased if needed for your applications\. For information about service quotas and to request a quota increase, see [AWS Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html)\. 

Remember the following information when using Amazon Comprehend\.

## Supported Regions<a name="limits-regions"></a>

For a list of AWS Regions where Amazon Comprehend is available, see [AWS Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#comprehend_region) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

## Overall Quotas<a name="limits-all"></a>

All single\-document synchronous operations except sentiment analysis and syntax detection have the following quotas\.


| Description | Quota/Guideline | 
| --- | --- | 
| Character encoding | UTF\-8 | 
| Maximum document size  | 100 KB | 

The maximum document size for sentiment analysis, syntax detection, and the batch synchronous operations is 5 KB\.

**Note**  
Amazon Comprehend performs real\-time sentiment analysis on the first 500 characters of the input text and ignores any additional text in the input\.

Amazon Comprehend may store your content to continuously improve the quality of its analysis models\. See the [Amazon Comprehend FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/faqs/) to learn more\. 

## Throttling for single transactions<a name="limits-throttling"></a>

You may be able to avoid throttling by using the batch operations instead of the single transaction operations\. For more information, see [Multiple document operations](#limits-batch)\.

## Multiple document operations<a name="limits-batch"></a>

The [BatchDetectDominantLanguage](API_BatchDetectDominantLanguage.md), [BatchDetectEntities](API_BatchDetectEntities.md), [BatchDetectKeyPhrases](API_BatchDetectKeyPhrases.md), and [BatchDetectSentiment](API_BatchDetectSentiment.md) operations have the following quotas\.


| Description | Quota/Guideline | 
| --- | --- | 
| Documents per request | 25 | 

If you plan to send more than 20 requests per second, you should consider using the batch operations\. With batch operations, you send more documents in each request, which may result in higher throughput\. For example, when you use the `DetectDominantLanguage` operation, you can send up to 20 documents per second\. However, if you use the `BatchRequestDominantLanguage` operation, you can send up to 250 documents per second, but processing speed may be lower\. For more information about throttling quotas, see [ Amazon Comprehend Quotas ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_amazon_comprehend) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\. For more information about using the multiple document API operations, see [Multiple document synchronous processing](concepts-processing-modes.md#how-batch)\.

## Concurrent active asynchronous jobs<a name="limits-active-jobs"></a>

You create new analysis jobs using the Amazon Comprehend console or one of the `API_Start*` operations\. Each account can have up to 10 concurrent active jobs of a given job type\. 


| Description | Quota/Guideline | 
| --- | --- | 
| Maximum number of concurrent active jobs per job type | 10 | 

## Asynchronous jobs<a name="limits-asynchronous"></a>

Asynchronous analysis jobs that you run using one of the `API_Start*` operations have the following quotas\.


| Description | Quota/Guideline | 
| --- | --- | 
| Maximum size of each document in jobs that detect entities, key phrases, PII, and languages | 1 MB | 
| Maximum size of each document in jobs that detect sentiment | 5 KB | 
| Total size of all files in batch | 5 GB | 
| Maximum number of files, one document per file | 1,000,000 | 

You should use the asynchronous operations:
+ To analyze more than 25 documents at a time
+ To analyze documents larger than 5,000 bytes for keywords and entities

For more information, see [Asynchronous batch processing](concepts-processing-modes.md#how-async)\.

## Targeted sentiment<a name="limits-targeted-sentiment"></a>

Targeted sentiment supports only asynchronous analysis jobs\. Jobs created with the [StartTargetedSentimentDetectionJob](API_StartTargetedSentimentDetectionJob.md) operation have the following quotas\.

The [BatchDetectDominantLanguage](API_BatchDetectDominantLanguage.md), [DetectDominantLanguage](API_DetectDominantLanguage.md) operations and asynchronous jobs started with the [StartDominantLanguageDetectionJob](API_StartDominantLanguageDetectionJob.md) operation have the following limitations:
+ They don't support phonetic language detection\. For example, they will not detect "arigato" as Japanese nor "nihao" as Chinese\.
