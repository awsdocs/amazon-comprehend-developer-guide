# Guidelines and Quotas<a name="guidelines-and-limits"></a>

Many of the Amazon Comprehend quotas shown here can be increased if needed for your applications\. For information about service quotas and to request a quota increase, see [AWS Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html)\. 

Remember the following information when using Amazon Comprehend\.

## Supported Regions<a name="limits-regions"></a>

For a list of AWS Regions where Amazon Comprehend is available, see [AWS Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#comprehend_region) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

## Overall Quotas<a name="limits-all"></a>

All operations except asynchronous operations and topic modeling operations have the following quotas:


| Description | Quota/Guideline | 
| --- | --- | 
| Character encoding | UTF\-8 | 
| Document size \(UTF\-8 characters\) | 5,000 bytes | 

Synchronous requests to label documents with PII using the [ ContainsPiiEntities ](API_ContainsPiiEntities.md) operation have the following quotas:


| Description | Quota/Guideline | 
| --- | --- | 
| Character encoding | UTF\-8 | 
| Document size \(UTF\-8 characters\) | 50,000 bytes | 

Amazon Comprehend may store your content to continuously improve the quality of its analysis models\. See the [Amazon Comprehend FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/faqs/) to learn more\. 

## Throttling When Using Single Transactions<a name="limits-throttling"></a>

You may be able to avoid throttling by using the batch operations instead of the single transaction operations\. For more information, see [Multiple Document Operations](#limits-batch)\.

## Multiple Document Operations<a name="limits-batch"></a>

The [ BatchDetectDominantLanguage ](API_BatchDetectDominantLanguage.md), [ BatchDetectEntities ](API_BatchDetectEntities.md), [ BatchDetectKeyPhrases ](API_BatchDetectKeyPhrases.md), and [ BatchDetectSentiment ](API_BatchDetectSentiment.md) operations have the following quotas:


| Description | Quota/Guideline | 
| --- | --- | 
| Documents per request | 25 | 

If you plan to send more than 20 requests per second, you should consider using the batch operations\. Batch operations enable you to send more documents in each request which may result in higher throughput\. For example, when you use the `DetectDominantLanguage` operation, you can send up to 20 documents per second\. However, if you use the `BatchRequestDominantLanguage` operation, you can send up to 250 documents per second, but processing speed may be lower\. For more information about throttling quotas see [ Amazon Comprehend Quotas ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_amazon_comprehend) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\. For more information about using the multiple document APIs, see [Multiple Document Synchronous Processing](how-batch.md)\.

## Asynchronous Operations<a name="limits-asynchronous"></a>

Asynchronous batch jobs are run with the [ StartDominantLanguageDetectionJob ](API_StartDominantLanguageDetectionJob.md), [ StartEntitiesDetectionJob ](API_StartEntitiesDetectionJob.md), [ StartKeyPhrasesDetectionJob ](API_StartKeyPhrasesDetectionJob.md), [ StartPiiEntitiesDetectionJob ](API_StartPiiEntitiesDetectionJob.md), and [ StartSentimentDetectionJob ](API_StartSentimentDetectionJob.md) operations\. These jobs have the following limits:


| Description | Quota/Guideline | 
| --- | --- | 
| Maximum size of each document in jobs that detect entities, key phrases, PII, and languages | 1 MB | 
| Maximum size of each document in jobs that detect sentiment | 5 KB | 
| Total size of all files in batch | 5 GB | 
| Maximum number of files, one document per file | 1,000,000 | 

You should use the asynchronous operations:
+ To analyze more than 25 documents at a time
+ To analyze documents larger than 5,000 bytes for keywords and entities

For more information, see [Asynchronous Batch Processing](how-async.md)\.

## Document Classification<a name="limits-document-classification"></a>

Document classifier training jobs started with the [ CreateDocumentClassifier ](API_CreateDocumentClassifier.md) operation, asynchronous document classification jobs started with the [ StartDocumentClassificationJob ](API_StartDocumentClassificationJob.md) , and synchronous document classification requests started with the [ ClassifyDocument ](API_ClassifyDocument.md) operation have the following limits:

## Language Detection<a name="limits-language-detection"></a>

The [ BatchDetectDominantLanguage ](API_BatchDetectDominantLanguage.md), [ DetectDominantLanguage ](API_DetectDominantLanguage.md) operations and asynchronous jobs started with the [ StartDominantLanguageDetectionJob ](API_StartDominantLanguageDetectionJob.md) operation have the following limitations:
+ They don't support phonetic language detection\. For example, they will not detect "arigato" as Japanese nor "nihao" as Chinese\.
+ They may have trouble distinguishing close language pairs, such as Indonesian and Malay; or Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian\.
+ For best results the input text should be at least 20 characters long\.
