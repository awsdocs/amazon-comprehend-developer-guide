# Authentication and access control for Amazon Comprehend<a name="auth-and-access-control"></a>

Access to Amazon Comprehend requires credentials that AWS can use to authenticate your requests\. Those credentials must have permissions to access Amazon Comprehend actions\. The following sections provide details on how you can use [AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) and Amazon Comprehend to help secure your resources by controlling who can access them\.

## Authentication<a name="authentication"></a>

You can access AWS as any of the following types of identities:
+ **AWS account root user**

    When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign\-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. This identity is called the AWS account *root user* and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account\. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks\. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to perform the tasks that only the root user can perform\. For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see [Tasks that require root user credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root) in the *AWS General Reference*\. 
+ **IAM users and groups**  

  An *[IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html)* is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions for a single person or application\. An IAM user can have long\-term credentials such as a user name and password or a set of access keys\. To learn how to generate access keys, see [Managing access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. When you generate access keys for an IAM user, make sure you view and securely save the key pair\. You cannot recover the secret access key in the future\. Instead, you must generate a new access key pair\.

  An [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html) is an identity that specifies a collection of IAM users\. You can't sign in as a group\. You can use groups to specify permissions for multiple users at a time\. Groups make permissions easier to manage for large sets of users\. For example, you could have a group named *IAMAdmins* and give that group permissions to administer IAM resources\.

  Users are different from roles\. A user is uniquely associated with one person or application, but a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it\. Users have permanent long\-term credentials, but roles provide temporary credentials\. To learn more, see [When to create an IAM user \(instead of a role\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html#id_which-to-choose) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
+ **IAM role**

    An [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions\. An IAM role is similar to an IAM user in that it is an AWS identity with permissions policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS\. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it\. Also, a role does not have standard long\-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it\. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session\. IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations:
  + **Federated user access** –  Instead of creating an IAM user, you can use existing identities from AWS Directory Service, your enterprise user directory, a web identity provider, or the IAM Identity Center identity store\. These identities are known as *federated identities*\. To assign permissions to federated identities, you can create a role and define permissions for the role\. When an external identity authenticates, the identity is associated with the role and is granted the permissions that are defined by it\. If you use IAM Identity Center, you configure a permission set\. IAM Identity Center correlates the permission set to a role in IAM to control what your identities can access after they authenticate\. For more information about identity federation, see [ Creating a role for a third\-party Identity Provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. For more information about IAM Identity Center, see [ What is IAM Identity Center?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) in the *AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\) User Guide*\. 
  + **AWS service access** –  A service role is an [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf\. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM\. For more information, see [Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 
  + **Applications running on Amazon EC2** –  You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests\. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance\. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the instance\. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials\. For more information, see [Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

## Access control<a name="access-control"></a>

 You must have valid credentials to authenticate your requests\. The credentials must have permissions to call an Amazon Comprehend action\.
