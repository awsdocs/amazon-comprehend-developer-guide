# Analysis using the Amazon Comprehend console<a name="get-started-console"></a>

You can use the Amazon Comprehend console to analyze documents in real\-time or to run asynchronous analysis jobs\.

Using real\-time analysis with built\-in models, you can recognize entities, extract key phrases, detect primary language, detect PII, determine sentiment, and analyze syntax\. 

You can run analysis jobs using the built\-in models to find insights such as entities, events, phrases, primary language, sentiment, targeted sentiment, and personally identifiable information \(PII\)\. You can also run topic\-modeling jobs\. 

The console also supports real\-time and asynchronous analysis using custom models\. For more information, see [Custom classification](how-document-classification.md) and [Custom entity recognition](custom-entity-recognition.md)\.
