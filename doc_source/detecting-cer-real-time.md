# Real\-time analysis for custom entity recognition \(console\)<a name="detecting-cer-real-time"></a>

You can use the Amazon Comprehend console to run real\-time analysis with a custom model\. First, you create an endpoint to run the real\-time analysis\. After you create the endpoint, you run the real\-time analysis\.

For information about provisioning endpoint throughput, and the associated costs, see [Using Amazon Comprehend endpoints](using-endpoints.md)\.

## Creating an endpoint for custom entity detection<a name="detecting-cer-real-time-create-endpoint"></a>

**To create an endpoint \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Comprehend console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/comprehend/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/)

1. From the left menu, choose **Endpoints** and choose the **Create endpoint** button\. A **Create endpoint** screen opens\.

1. Give the endpoint a name\. The name must be unique within the current Region and account\.

1. Choose a custom model that you want to attach the new endpoint to\. From the dropdown, you can search by model name\.
**Note**  
You must create a model before you can attach an endpoint to it\. If you don't have a model yet, see [Training custom entity recognizer models](training-recognizers.md)\. 

1. \(Optional\) To add a tag to the endpoint, enter a key\-value pair under **Tags** and choose **Add tag**\. To remove this pair before creating the endpoint, choose **Remove tag**\.

1. Enter the number of inference units \(IUs\) to assign to the endpoint\. Each unit represents a throughput of 100 characters per second for up to two documents per second\. For more information about endpoint throughput, see [Using Amazon Comprehend endpoints](using-endpoints.md)\.

1. \(Optional\) If you are creating a new endpoint, you have the option to use the IU estimator\. The estimator can help you determine the number of IUs to request\. The number of inference units depends on the throughput or the number of characters that you want to analyze per second\.

1. From the **Purchase summary**, review your estimated hourly, daily, and monthly endpoint cost\. 

1. Select the check box if you understand that your account accrues charges for the endpoint from the time it starts until you delete it\.

1. Choose **Create endpoint**\.

## Running real\-time custom entity detection<a name="detecting-cer-real-time-run"></a>

After you create an endpoint for your custom entity recognizer model, you can run real\-time analysis to detect entities in individual documents\.

Complete the following steps to detect custom entities in your text by using the Amazon Comprehend console\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Comprehend console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/comprehend/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/)

1. From the left menu, choose **Real\-time analysis**\.

1. In the **Input text** section, for **Analysis type**, choose **Custom**\. 

1. For **Select endpoint**, choose the endpoint that is associated with the entity\-detection model that you want to use\.

1. To specify the input data for analysis, you can input text or upload a file\.
   + To enter text:

     1. Choose **Input text**\.

     1. Enter the text that you want to analyze\. 
   + To upload a file:

     1. Choose **Upload file** and enter the filename to upload\.

     1. \(Optional\) Under **Advanced read actions**, you can override the default actions for text extraction\. For details, see [Setting text extraction options](idp-set-textract-options.md)\.

1. Choose **Analyze**\. The console displays the output of the analysis, along with a confidence assessment\.
