# Detect Events<a name="how-events"></a>

## <a name="events-result-schema"></a>

With Amazon Comprehend, you can analyze your text documents to detect speciÔ¨Åc types of events and related details\. You can apply natural language processing with asynchronous jobs for event detection across large collections of documents\. 

You can use the [StartEventsDetectionJob](API_StartEventsDetectionJob.md) operation to detect events\.

### Detect Events Results<a name="how-events-results"></a>

When your event detection job completes, Amazon Comprehend writes the analysis results to the Amazon S3 output location that you specified\.

For each detected event, the output provides details in the following format:

```

#### Entities<a name="how-events-entities"></a>

Amazon Comprehend returns a list of entities from the input text that are related to the detected event\. An *entity* can be a real\-world object, such as a person, place, or location; an entity can also be a concept, such as a measurement, date, or quantity\. Each occurrence of an entity is identified by a *mention*, which is a textual reference to the entity in the input text\. For each unique entity, all mentions are grouped into a list\. This list provides details for each location in the input text where the entity occurs\. Only entities associated with a supported event type will be detected\. You can use the [DetectEntities](API_DetectEntities.md) and [StartEntitiesDetectionJob](API_StartEntitiesDetectionJob.md) operation to detect additional entities\.

Each entity associated with a supported event type returns with the following related details:
+ **Mentions**: Details for each occurrence of the same entity in the input text\.
  + **BeginOffset**: A character offset in the input text that shows where the mention begins \(the first character is at position 0\)\. 
  + **EndOffset**: A character offset in the input text that shows where the mention ends\.
  + **Score**: The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the accuracy of the entity's type\.
  + **GroupScore**: The level of confidence from Amazon Comprehend that the mention is correctly grouped with other mentions of the same entity\.
  + **Text**: The text of the entity\.
  + **Type**: The entity's type\. For all supported entity types, see [Entity Types](#events-entity-types)\.

#### Events<a name="how-events-output"></a>

Amazon Comprehend returns a list of events detected in the input text\. Only supported event types will be detected\.

Each event returns with the following related details:
+ **Type**: The event's type\. For all supported event types, see [Event Types](#events-types)\.
+ **Arguments**: A list of arguments that are related to the detected event\. An *argument* consists of an entity that is related to the detected event\. The argument's role describes the relationship, such as *who* did *what*, *where *and *when*\.
  + **EntityIndex**: An index value that identifies an entity from the list of entities that Amazon Comprehend returned for this analysis\.
  + **Role**: The argument type, which describes how the entity for this argument is related to the event\. For all supported argument types, see [Argument Types](#events-argument-types)\.
  + **Score**: The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the accuracy of the role detection\.
+ **Triggers**: A list of triggers for the detected event\. A *trigger* is a single word or phrase that indicates the occurrence of the event\.
  + **BeginOffset**: A character offset in the input text that shows where the trigger begins \(the first character is at position 0\)\.
  + **EndOffset**: A character offset in the input text that shows where the trigger ends\.
  + **Score**: The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the accuracy of the detection\.
  + **Text**: The text of the trigger\.
  + **GroupScore**: The level of confidence from Amazon Comprehend that the trigger is correctly grouped with other triggers for the same event\.
  + **Type**: The type of event that this trigger indicates\.
